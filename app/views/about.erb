	<h3>Hola, my name is Elliot James Dickison.</h3>
	<p>I'm an Idaho boy, married to a <a href="http://jayloizeaux.wordpress.com">Colorado girl</a>. I love Jesus, Jill, skiing, and programming. In my free time I enjoy programming and building websites (like this one). I like to think of myself as some level of full-stack web developer. I currently work with an amazing group of people at <a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com" target="emsi">Economic Modeling Specialists International</a>.</p>
